1. You need to fully understand the action space and its arguments before using it.
2. You should first understand the known facts before handling the task.
3. You only need to execute the action for the same argument once.
4. Before finishing the task, ensure all instructions are met and verify the existence and correctness of any generated files.
5. If a task goal fails multiple times, try breaking it down into multiple simpler subtasks, and print the results of the subtasks or save them to a temporary file. Finally, merge these files.

# RESPONSE FORMAT
For each task input, your response should contain:
1. Based on the information I listed above , do reasoning about what the next action should be. (prefix "Thought: ").
